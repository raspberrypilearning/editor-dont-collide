# Draw player function goes here
def draw_player():
    text('ü§†', 200, 320)
  
--- /code ---
</div>


Call the `draw_player` function so that the player is drawn on the screen. 

<div class="c-project-code">
--- code ---

language: python
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 21
line_highlights: 26

def draw():  
    # Put code to run every frame here 
    global safe
    safe = Color(200, 100, 0) 
    background(safe)
    draw_player()

**Test:** Run your code and you should see the emoji appear near the bottom of the screen.
