<h2 class="c-project-heading--task">Lots of obstacles</h2>

--- task ---
‚û°Ô∏è Use a loop to generate multiple obstacles.
--- /task --- 
 
Add a loop and indent the code to draw an obstacle. The loop will run this code multiple times. Change the number inside `range()` to control how many obstacles are created.

<div class="c-project-code">

def draw_obstacles():
    seed(1234)
    for i in range(8):
        obstacle_x = randint(0, screen_size)
        obstacle_y = randint(0, screen_size) + frame_count
        obstacle_y = obstacle_y % screen_size
        text('üåµ', obstacle_x, obstacle_y)

</div>

**Test:** Run your code and you should see several obstacles.

### Debugging

Make sure that the code for the seed is outside of the loop, otherwise all of your obstacles will be generated on top of each other!
