### Tip

Here are some examples for things you could do using the skills you have already learned in this project:

- Use different emojis to represent the player and the obstacles
- Draw the player or the obstacles using shapes instead (you learned this in the [Make a face](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/editor-make-a-face/editor){:target="_blank"} project)
- Draw the player or the obstacles using images instead (you learned this in the [Rocket launch](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/editor-rocket-launch/editor){:target="_blank"}  project)

- Change one line of code to make the obstacles move faster
- Create a variable and add one to it each time the player crashes
- Make the obstacles move faster after every crash

- Add an item for the player to pick up, which disappears when the player touches it
- Add a variable to keep track of the player's score

- Stop the game if the player crashes
- Display a text message on the screen to say 'Game over'
